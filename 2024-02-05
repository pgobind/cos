Furthermore, it is important to counter the claim that AWS service limits are hard limits. AWS provides mechanisms to request quota increases, and many of these limits are soft limits that can be adjusted based on business needs. However, relying on AWS quota increases is not a sustainable solution when compared to a well-structured multi-account strategy, which inherently provides scalability, performance isolation, and operational efficiency without requiring frequent quota adjustments.

4. The Misconception of Microservices and Account Consolidation

Another point to address is the misinterpretation of microservices architecture in the context of AWS account consolidation. The argument that a single AWS account is more aligned with microservices architecture is flawed because:

Microservices are designed to be loosely coupled and independently scalable. Enforcing them to share an AWS account introduces operational bottlenecks and resource contention.

Service Quotas Apply Across Microservices: If multiple microservices operate within a single AWS account, they will be subject to the same limits, increasing the risk of throttling and degraded performance.

Security Risks Multiply: A misconfigured IAM role or excessive permissions in one microservice could inadvertently affect others.

Microservices benefit the most when deployed in a multi-account architecture, ensuring better governance, security isolation, and performance scalability.
