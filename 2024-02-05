End-to-End Flow for AWS Glue vs. EMR Serverless Analysis
1. Understanding the Business Problem
The organization processes 500 Spark-based reconciliation jobs per day.
Each job handles 200GB of data, with shuffle-heavy joins and aggregations.
The workload includes batch processing with real-time polling.
2. Identifying the Key Challenges
AWS Glue has high shuffle overhead, increasing job execution time and cost.
AWS Glue does not support real-time polling efficiently.
AWS Glue requires modifications to execute Spring Boot Spark JARs.
3. Technical Comparison: AWS Glue vs. EMR Serverless
Feature	AWS Glue	EMR Serverless
Execution Model	New cluster per job (fixed DPUs)	Auto-scaling Spark session
Startup Time	1-2 min/job	Faster due to session reuse
Shuffle & Join Performance	High overhead, limited tuning	Optimized shuffle, better caching
Batch Processing Suitability	Good but costly for large datasets	Optimized for heavy batch workloads
Real-time Polling	Not supported efficiently	Supports long-running Spark jobs
Handling of Large Workloads	Slow, expensive	Better memory & CPU efficiency
Cost Efficiency	Fixed DPU pricing, inefficient for large joins	Granular pricing (vCPU & GB-second)
Spring Boot JAR Support	Requires adaptation	Supports direct execution of pre-built JARs
4. Performance & Cost Comparison (500 Jobs/Day, 200GB per Job)
Metric	AWS Glue (20 DPUs)	EMR Serverless (100 vCPUs, 400GB RAM)
Job Duration (Hours)	1.5 hours	1.2 hours
Jobs Per Day	500	500
Compute Cost Per Job	$13.20	$8.68
Total Daily Cost	$6,600/day ($198,000/month)	$4,340/day ($130,200/month)
4.1 Key Insights
EMR Serverless is ~20% faster per job (1.2 hours vs. 1.5 hours).
EMR Serverless is ~34% cheaper per job ($8.68 vs. $13.20).
Total savings: $2,260/day (~$67,800/month).
5. Execution Proofs: Screenshots and Performance Logs

6. Why AWS Glue is Not Suitable
6.1 High Costs for Shuffle-Heavy Workloads
AWS Glue's DPU-based pricing model is inefficient for:

Large-scale joins & aggregations.
High-concurrency workloads (500 jobs/day).
Processing large datasets (200GB+ per job).
6.2 Inefficient Real-time Processing
AWS Glue cannot efficiently handle streaming sources (Kafka, SQS, ActiveMQ, DataX).
EMR Serverless supports event-driven workloads.
6.3 Incompatible with Spring Boot JARs
AWS Glue requires modification to execute Spring Boot-based Spark JARs.
EMR Serverless supports direct execution.
7. Why EMR Serverless is the Better Choice
7.1 Faster Execution & Scalability
Optimized shuffle performance.
Auto-scales Spark resources dynamically.
Better memory management → fewer job failures.
7.2 Cost Efficiency
Granular pay-per-second model prevents overprovisioning.
34% cost reduction vs. AWS Glue.
7.3 Supports Both Batch & Real-time Workloads
Supports long-running Spark jobs for polling MQ & streaming sources.
Handles hybrid batch and streaming workloads.
7.4 Seamless Integration with Spring Boot JARs
No code modifications required.
Direct execution of pre-built JARs.
8. Conclusion & Recommendation
Factor	AWS Glue	EMR Serverless
Cost (500 jobs/day, 200GB each)	$198,000/month	$130,200/month (34% savings)
Performance (Shuffle & Joins)	Slow, expensive	Faster, optimized
Real-time Workload Support	Not supported	Supported (Kafka, MQ, DataX, etc.)
Pre-built Spring Boot JARs	Requires adaptation	Runs existing JARs seamlessly
Final Recommendation
Migrate from AWS Glue to EMR Serverless to achieve: ✅ 34% cost reduction ($67,800/month savings).
✅ 20% faster job execution.
✅ Better scalability and shuffle handling.
✅ Support for real-time processing & event-driven workloads.
✅ Seamless execution of Spring Boot Spark JARs.

9. Next Steps for Migration
Validate migration strategy for existing Spark workloads.
Optimize EMR Serverless configurations for cost efficiency.
Implement real-time streaming pipelines for event-driven Spark workloads.
