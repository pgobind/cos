• Bedrock Gen‑AI rule assistant prototypes show ≈ 30 % faster onboarding.
Platform modernisation	First in CDT to implement kerberisation, NADC migration, and Spring Cloud Gateway forward‑proxy patterns; templates now reused across PFS.
Cost stewardship	EMR & Glue tuning lowered batch compute expense ≈ 28 % while sustaining SLA.

Client / Customer / Stakeholder
•	Controllers & Ops – Reconciliation screens reduced break‑research time from 2 days → ≈ 2 h.
•	Data contracts – Aligned Nessie (GMI), MDL, IRCes and OTC Ops; > 99.9 % reconciliation accuracy first month.
•	Regulatory alignment – Earlier EMIR reporting design and Control‑M automations ensured timely submissions across 14 jurisdictions.

Knowledge Sharing: Ran 9 AWS workshops (Lambda, Glue, EMR, Transfer Family, CI/CD) for 50+ engineers; post‑quiz scores up ≈ 22 %.
Collaboration & Support: In PFS chat, answered 150+ queries and resolved ≈ 25 critical blockers (network ACLs, IAM auth, cost guardrails).
Project Bootstrapping: Set up net‑new projects (repos, Jules pipelines, GAP/GKP, GOS PAVE) and coached teams on secure deployment patterns.
Mentoring & Culture: Guides 4 Associates (2 on VP track); launched “Women in Cloud FinTech” brown‑bag – attendance up 5× in 6 months.
(Formal people‑manager responsibility not yet assigned; leads virtual squads of 15–20 engineers.)

•	AI Tooling – Prototyped YAML rule scaffolding & test‑case generators (SmartSDLC hackathon, bronze); early tests indicate ≈ 30 % productivity gain.
•	Community anchor – Shares scripts and how‑to docs for PFS connectivity, MQ/Kafka setup, and AWS networking.
6) Development Areas
•	Executive storytelling – Sharpen cost‑avoidance / risk‑reduction narrative for C‑suite.
