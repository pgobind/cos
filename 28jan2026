1. What does Smart SDLC do?
Smart SDLC is an AI-assisted SDLC co-pilot that aligns leadership intent, engineering design, delivery execution, and operational outcomes—so teams build the right thing, the right way, with continuity across the lifecycle and better consumer outcomes.
2. What lifecycle stage are we in?
We are in an early prototype / validation stage, proving cross-role value (leadership, engineering, delivery, ops) and end-to-end workflows before enterprise hardening.
3. How many systems are using it? What is needed for widespread adoption?
Currently piloted on 1–2 systems; scaling requires security and platform hardening, standard integrations (JIRA, Git, Confluence), and role-based onboarding for engineering, delivery, and operations teams.
4. Feature roadmap ahead
Near-term: deepen role-based experiences for leadership, engineers, delivery and ops with traceability and governance;
Mid-term: enterprise integrations, metrics-driven insights, and consumer-impact feedback loops.
