Yes — we’re designing this as Control-as-a-Service, fully API-exposed with Maker/Checker. We can support multiple invocation modes:

Validate/Preview (dry-run): client/Ops can run an eligibility check and see expected results without committing or triggering downstream steps.

Execute: run the full end-to-end control flow after approval.

Step-level control / stop-after: optionally stop after producing output, or proceed only to specific actions (e.g., book in GMI) based on user intent.
This gives clients the flexibility to “check” first, then execute when ready, with auditability and idempotent behavior.
