Dear [Manager's Manager's Name],

I trust this message reaches you in good health and spirits. I am writing to you to address a concern that has progressively impacted my work-life balance and overall well-being. Having been a committed member of our team for several years,
I value the dedication and hard work that goes into our shared achievements. 
However, I find myself at a juncture where I must seek your guidance and support.

For the past six years, my workload has frequently extended me to work 13-14 hours a day, including weekends. This pattern has been the norm rather than the exception, 
and while I have managed to meet the demands thus far, the intensity and duration of such hours are proving to be challenging. 
The limited time off afforded to me during significant personal events, such as family losses and health issues, has further compounded the situation.

With the anticipated arrival of my first child in the next week, I am prompted to reassess the sustainability of my current work dynamics. I am eager to continue contributing to our team's success while also being present for my growing family's needs.

I am seeking a dialogue on how we might address this long-standing trend of extended work hours. My aim is to find a more balanced structure that allows for sustained productivity and the maintenance of personal health and family life.

Could we possibly schedule a meeting to discuss this matter further? I am open to ideas and willing to explore various avenues that could lead to a mutually beneficial arrangement. I appreciate your understanding and am hopeful for a positive step forward.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,

[Your Full Name] [Your Position] [Your Contact Information]
