Initiating from Scratch: "We started with nothing in hand and painstakingly built up the ENCORE infrastructure from the ground, setting up SEAL and navigating through the extensive processes to establish DevX, JET, and the necessary repositories."

Navigating Architectural Challenges: "Our journey required constant follow-ups with the architectural and design teams, as we meticulously worked through the complexities of securing AOS approvals and finalizing a robust AWS system design."

Establishing Connectivity and Certifications: "We ensured seamless integration with existing services through MQ connectivity and pioneered the setup of MFTS for the new AWS account. Additionally, we implemented the CKMS automated certificate API to bolster our security measures."

Pipeline and Project Setup: "For the first time, we took on the challenge of setting up the Jules pipeline, demonstrating our capability to adapt and learn on the fly, while also taking the responsibility of setting up new projects."

Building an Event-Driven Architecture: "We delved deep into creating an event-driven architecture, connecting S3/SQS to Lambda to EMR, showcasing our technical skills, and ensuring a seamless data flow for optimal performance."

Operational Support and AWS Expertise: "Even after the initial setup, we continued to provide essential operational support and AWS expertise, ensuring that the ENCORE infrastructure was not just functioning but thriving under our careful watch."
