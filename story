45-minute version (works perfectly for leadership)
2.1 0:00–5:00 Hook + stakes

Say (free-flow):
“Imagine leadership asks, ‘Are we on track?’
We think we know — but then we spend the next hour reconstructing truth from decks, chats, and tribal memory.
We still deliver… but we deliver by manual traction — invisible threads held by a few seniors.
And that does not scale.”

Then set the promise:
“Today I’ll show one initiative end-to-end, in a story.
Not a UI tour. A delivery journey.”

2.2 5:00–10:00 The problem in leadership language

Say:
“The core cost isn’t engineering. It’s the coordination tax:

context reconstruction

risk hidden until late

approvals scattered

dependency blast radius unknown

senior time becomes the bottleneck”

End with your thesis:
“Smart SDLC converts manual traction into systemic leverage.”

2.3 10:00–30:00 The story demo (one initiative, 4 chapters)

You run this as Chapter 1–4. Each chapter is 5 mins.

Chapter 1 (10:00–15:00) PO: “Intent becomes an object”

Show: create initiative from spec / create from template
Say:
“Work begins unstructured. AI helps convert it into structured intent — but governance starts it as Draft.”

Key 3 things only:

Scope + outcomes

FR/NFR draft

Risks/dependencies draft

Transition line:
“Now the PO has intent. But intent isn’t delivery until it’s clarified.”

Chapter 2 (15:00–20:00) BA: “Clarity removes churn”

Show: refine requirements, add acceptance criteria, resolve ambiguity
Say:
“This is where we stop rework early. AI helps spot missing NFRs, vague acceptance criteria, and inconsistent statements.”

Transition line:
“Now we have clarity. But clarity isn’t safe until architecture is governed.”

Chapter 3 (20:00–25:00) Architect: “Governance without drag”

Show: architecture artifact + maker/checker + version/diff + approvals
Say:
“AI can draft, but humans approve. What matters is:

what is approved

what changed

who signed off

what standards were satisfied”

Transition line:
“Now it’s approved. Now execution starts — and this is where most tools become ‘status narration’. We won’t.”

Chapter 4 (25:00–30:00) Dev: “Progress is evidence, not narration”

Show: dev tasks tied to requirements + evidence objects (PR, builds, tests, deploy)
Say:
“We don’t say ‘70% done’. We show proof: PRs, builds, tests, deployments, controls evidence.
That’s how leaders get truth without chasing updates.”

2.4 30:00–40:00 Leadership payoff (Director/MD view)

Show: portfolio/initiative health + blockers + dependencies + “what changed since last week”
Say:
“This is the executive outcome:

What’s blocked

Why it’s blocked

Who owns it

What it impacts

What evidence supports the status”

Then drop the AI question proactively:
“If someone asks ‘where is AI?’ — AI is doing 3 jobs:

convert unstructured to structured delivery objects

detect gaps/drift/risks against evidence

generate drafts (req/tests/scaffolding) while approvals stay human”

2.5 40:00–45:00 Close with pilot ask

Say:
“We pilot, not big-bang: one initiative, 4–6 weeks.
Success metrics: fewer status meetings, faster approvals, reduced rework, better audit readiness.
What I need: one sponsor, one pilot initiative, agreement on outcomes.”

3. 60-minute version (when they want depth)

Same story, but you add two “deep dive” inserts and 10-min Q&A.

3.1 Insert A (extra 7–10 mins): “Evidence chain + audit”

After Dev chapter, show:

audit trail

approvals log

decision log / ADR
Narration:
“This is institutional memory. This is where the firm wins long-term: risk reduction + continuity.”

3.2 Insert B (extra 7–10 mins): “Multi-agent flow / maker-checker”

Show:

PO agent draft → BA refinement → Architect review → Dev tasks

reviewer feedback loop
Narration:
“AI isn’t one bot. It’s role-aligned agents working inside governance.”

3.3 50:00–60:00 Q&A, but controlled

Use this line to stay in control:
“I’ll take questions, but I’ll anchor answers back to the evidence chain.”

4. The key trick to make it feel like storytelling (not demo)

Use these 3 storytelling moves repeatedly:

4.1 “Zoom out → zoom in → zoom out”

Zoom out: “Here is the problem”

Zoom in: “Here is the feature that solves it”

Zoom out: “Here is what this changes for leadership”

4.2 Repeat the golden thread

Every transition:
“Spec → Requirements → Architecture → Evidence → Approvals → Audit → Portfolio truth”

4.3 Use short “micro-conflicts”

Make each chapter a mini story:

PO: “spec chaos” → “structured intent”

BA: “ambiguity” → “clarity”

Architect: “drift risk” → “governed approval”

Dev: “status narration” → “evidence proof”

Leadership: “guesswork” → “intervention with truth”

5. What to say when you feel you didn’t convey the work done

This is your “credibility paragraph” (use once, mid-way):

“What you’re seeing isn’t UI. It’s an operating model:

structured work objects

role-based governance

maker/checker approvals

versioning + diff

evidence-based progress

dependency blast radius

auditable history
That combination is the work — and that’s what creates leverage.”

6. If they ask “show all views”

Say this confidently:
“I’ll show all roles, but through one initiative story. Otherwise it becomes a UI tour and we miss the point — the point is leverage through an evidence chain.”

If you tell me your exact screens/views (PO, BA, Architect, Dev, Director, MD) and what is actually working today (create-from-spec? approvals? audit? dashboards?), I’ll write you a word-for-word 60-minute script with:

exact opening story,

chapter-by-chapter transitions,

“what to click / what to say while it loads”,

Q&A answers (AI, security, governance, adoption).
