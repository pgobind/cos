That context clarifies the nuance perfectly—it's about handling applications with varying criticality *within* the single, shared cluster.

Here is the revised, final set of crisp bullet points incorporating the variable RTO requirement:

  * **Shared Clusters are Recommended (Efficiency):** AWS encourages using one large cluster per environment/account for better resource utilization and reduced operational overhead, which is the default JPMC approach.

  * **VPC and Network Isolation is Fixed:** VPCs and subnets are **pre-provisioned** by JPMC's platform. Creating an extra cluster in the same VPC adds zero network isolation, as changes require modifying the AWS account request process.
  * **Isolation is Service-Level (Security):** Application security is achieved robustly **within** the shared cluster using granular Task IAM Roles and Security Groups, not by multiplying clusters.

  * **Blast Radius and Variable RTO (Agreement):** We agree that a shared cluster increases the blast radius. For applications with **different RTOs** running in the same ECS cluster, the standard mitigation is to use **different scaling policies** and **placement constraints** to prioritize critical services. Services with extremely low RTO requirements that cannot tolerate the shared blast radius would be better suited for a dedicated cluster or a separate account, justified as an exception via the account request process.
