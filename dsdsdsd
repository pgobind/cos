I appreciate the discussion on AWS account consolidation, but I would like to highlight several critical flaws in the argument that limits are "not real" and that consolidation is a viable path. My response is backed by AWS Well-Architected Framework best practices, AWS service limits, and recent AWS re:Invent discussions.

Let‚Äôs break this down with factual evidence from AWS documentation and real-world architectural concerns.

1. AWS Account Limits Are Practical, Not Theoretical Constraints
AWS documentation and service quotas clearly state that account limits exist for performance, security, and scalability reasons. Saying "we can quite easily go beyond them" misses the point that limits exist to protect workloads from failures, performance degradation, and AWS infrastructure constraints.

AWS Service	Current Default Limit	Scalability Concern with Consolidation
AWS Lambda	1,000 concurrent executions	Shared concurrency will lead to throttling for all seals.
Amazon S3	3,500 PUT/LIST/DELETE per second	Large-scale data ingestion across seals will hit throughput limits.
Amazon EC2	1,920 instances per region	Running multiple seals on the same account increases risk of hitting hard instance limits.
Amazon RDS/Aurora	40 DB instances per region	Increased likelihood of DB provisioning failures due to shared capacity.
AWS Glue	200 concurrent jobs	Shared resource contention between different workflows.
Amazon EMR	100 clusters per region	Unnecessary cluster competition for jobs between independent workloads.
API Gateway	10,000 requests per second	API request bursts from multiple seals could cause exhaustion.
ElastiCache	50 clusters per region	Multiple teams sharing the same limit would lead to resource starvation.
Rebuttal to ‚ÄúThese are not real limits‚Äù
AWS service quotas exist for scaling reasons ‚Äì hitting soft limits causes throttling and requires AWS support requests, which are not instant and impact production workloads.
AWS itself recommends decoupled, multi-account strategies for large-scale architectures (AWS Well-Architected Framework, Security Perspective).
re:Invent 2023 explicitly emphasized multi-account isolation for security and fault tolerance.

2. AWS re:Invent and Well-Architected Framework Strongly Recommend Multi-Account Strategies
AWS re:Invent 2023 Takeaways on Multi-Account Strategy
At AWS re:Invent 2023, AWS Principal Engineers and Field CTOs made strong recommendations for separate AWS accounts per business unit (BU) or functional domain, especially for:

Regulated financial workloads
High-scale distributed applications
Security and compliance-driven architectures

üìå AWS explicitly recommends account isolation for compliance-heavy industries. Ignoring these best practices would introduce unnecessary risk.

3. Major Risks in the Proposed Consolidation Plan
a. Security & Compliance Violation Risks
Consolidation increases the blast radius of security incidents. If one seal has a breach, all other seals in the same account are vulnerable.
Financial services have strict compliance requirements for data segregation (SOC, GDPR, SEC, CFTC) that AWS tags cannot enforce at the same level as accounts.

b. Operational Complexity Increases
IAM Policy Overload: 1,000 IAM policies per account is not sufficient when multiple seals are consolidated.
Inter-seal Resource Contention: Shared EC2, Lambda, and S3 buckets will experience scaling and performance degradation.
Difficult Cost Allocation: Multi-account billing enables precise cost tracking per business unit, which consolidation breaks.

c. Increased Risk of AWS Account-Level Failures
AWS account limits exist to ensure a single account failure doesn‚Äôt bring down an entire business unit.
Recent AWS outages (Dec 2023) showed that regional account isolation helped mitigate damage for businesses following AWS best practices.
