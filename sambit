1. Semantic Router & Context Window
Instead of just "Input," we analyze the intent.
The system dynamically assembles context from the Graph (Code + JIRA + Docs) before the LLM is even invoked.
2. Multi-Agent Orchestration (The "Brain")
Planner Agent: Breaks complex queries into sub-tasks (e.g., "Check architecture guidelines" + "Generate boilerplate").
Execution Agent: Calls specific Foundation Models via Bedrock.
Critic Agent: validaties the output against known constraints (Hallucination check).
3. Enterprise Guardrails (The "Lock")
Pre-Guard: PII redaction and permission enforcement.
Post-Guard: Syntax validation and "Human-in-the-Loop" approval gates for high-impact commits.
Feedback Loop: Accepted actions are fed back into Vector Memory to improve future reasoning.


Phase 1 is where we stand today: 'Connected Intelligence.'
We have moved beyond simple RAG. We have established a 'Unified Delivery Graph' that links Strategy to Code. We support every persona—Director, Architect, PO, Developer—with a single source of truth. We can already see dependencies; we know if a change in 'System A' breaks 'System B.' We have 'assisted' workflows live today.
Phase 2 is our leap into 'Autonomous Engineering.'
This is the shift from Assistant to Agent.
We are integrating Amazon Bedrock to move beyond generic models. We want the 'Smart SDLC' to be proactive.
Instead of a developer asking, 'How do I fix this?', a background agent detects a vulnerability, selects the best reasoning model—say, Claude 3.5—generates a fix, validates it against our governance rules, and simply asks the human to 'Approve.'
Phase 2 isn't about finding information; it’s about delegating work."
