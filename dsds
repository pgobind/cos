🧠 Project Name
ArchWise: AI-Powered AWS Architecture Explorer

🎯 One-Liner
An AI assistant that generates multiple AWS architecture options from a single project requirement — along with trade-offs on cost, performance, scalability, and resilience.

🔍 Problem Statement
Cloud solutioning often focuses on a single design path — but in reality, every architecture has trade-offs. For developers and architects working under time pressure (e.g., hackathons, MVPs, PoCs), it's hard to evaluate multiple AWS designs quickly and choose the best fit for their goals and constraints.

💡 What ArchWise Does
Accepts high-level requirements (e.g., “real-time API with low latency and high availability”)

Generates 2–3 alternative AWS architectures for the use case

For each architecture:

Lists key services used

Describes scaling strategies

Highlights cost vs performance vs operational overhead

Outputs a side-by-side trade-off analysis to help users choose

⚙️ How It Works
Frontend: React-based chat or form input

Backend:

Uses LLM (e.g., GPT-4) to interpret input and synthesize AWS architecture options

Leverages AWS Well-Architected Framework for best practices

Auto-generates architecture descriptions and comparison tables

(Optional) Uses Mermaid or Diagrams-as-Code to visualize options

🏗️ Architecture Example Output
Given input:

“Build a serverless analytics dashboard with near real-time updates and cost-efficiency”

ArchWise might output:

Option 1: Fully Serverless
Services: API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, Athena, QuickSight

Pros: Minimal ops, low cost, auto-scalable

Cons: Cold starts, eventual consistency

Use Case: Budget-sensitive dashboards with flexible latency

Option 2: Container-based
Services: ECS Fargate, Aurora Serverless, S3

Pros: More control, faster execution

Cons: Slightly higher cost, more config

Use Case: Medium-latency dashboards with consistent throughput

Option 3: Real-time Stream Processing
Services: Kinesis, Lambda, Redshift, QuickSight

Pros: Fast ingestion and query

Cons: Higher cost, complex integration

Use Case: High-frequency analytics dashboards

📈 Why This Is Valuable
Helps teams compare multiple cloud strategies quickly

Encourages architectural thinking over defaulting to “whatever works”

Drives better trade-off decisions (not just about cost, but performance and complexity)

🎓 Who Would Use This
Hackathon teams choosing a deploy strategy fast

Cloud architects validating design options

Developers learning AWS design patterns
